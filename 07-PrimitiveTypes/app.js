// There are six primitive types in JavaScript
// Primitive type: type of data that represents single value (not an object).

// We talked about this earlier you should never use this manually.
var undefinedVariable = undefined;

// Represents lack of existance.
var nullVariable = null;

// A true or false value, can also be thought of as a 0 (false) or a 1 (true).
var booleanVariable = true || false;

// This can be any integer or decimal number
// Numbers in JavaScript are considered "floating point"
// This means they always have a decimal associated with them.
// This can make calculation weird in JavaScript
var numberVariable = 1;

// Sequence of characters in both single and double quotes
// In other programming languages this is not considered a primitive type.
var stringVariable = "Lucas Werner";

// This is new to ES6 and we won't worry about it for now.
var symbolVariable = Symbol();
